# Recall plugins

AI plugins for the Recall notes app. They connect Cursor, Codex, and Claude Code to the
notes tools in Recall for Mac and statically register the Claude Desktop Chat
and Cowork routes documented below.
Automatic memory support is narrower than skill installation or direct tool
use; see the [host and memory support matrix](plugins/recall/README.md#host-and-memory-support)
for the current Cursor, Claude chat, Cowork, ChatGPT, Codex, Git, and non-Git boundary.

## Install from Recall for Mac

Use **Settings → Integrations** in Recall for Mac. This is the preferred setup
for every supported host.

1. Open the direct-download version of Recall and sign in.
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations**.
3. Click **Install & connect** for Claude Code or Codex. For Cursor, click
   **Show steps**. Install from **Customize → Plugins** after the package is
   published, or use the documented local-plugin path while testing it.
4. Go to **Settings → MCP Server** and choose **Block**, **Read**, or **Write**
   for each workspace.
5. Start a new agent thread. On the first connection, bring Recall to the
   front and approve the native access prompt.

Recall detects the agents installed on your Mac and shows what still needs to
be configured. Cursor stays guided because its public CLI does not expose a
supported plugin-install command:

After setup, the page confirms the plugin, local bridge access, and ACP
runtime for each agent:

The direct-download app can add the Claude/Codex marketplace and plugin, enable
Recall's local MCP server, and prepare their pinned ACP runtimes. Cursor owns
its plugin install UI, so Recall opens verified Cursor-specific steps instead. The
sandboxed App Store build also uses guided steps for every host. The plugin's
comment-mention inbox is manual — an agent answers a request only in a
conversation you run — while automatic replies to mentions are a separate,
opt-in Recall app feature that the plugin does not provide.

Installation never grants access to a workspace. Workspace permissions stay
separate under **Settings → MCP Server**. The current plugin connects through
Recall's signed local bridge and asks for native approval for each signed host
on first use. Cursor cannot inherit Claude or Codex approval merely by copying
their plugin files. You can revoke each host independently under **Local bridge
access**. Older Recall
builds fall back to browser OAuth.

## Other setup guides

- [Install Cursor, Claude Code, or Codex manually](docs/manual-installation.md) if you
  use the App Store build, need a terminal workflow, or are maintaining an
  older installation.
- [Connect Hermes Agent](docs/hermes-agent.md) directly to Recall's local HTTP
  MCP server with OAuth, then install the Recall skill so Hermes knows how to
  use it. Hermes does not need the Claude Code or Codex plugin.

## Plugin behavior

`plugins/recall` connects Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, and supported Claude Desktop
surfaces to the local MCP server hosted by the Recall Mac app. The plugin does
not run a notes server itself; it points the agent at the loopback endpoint
already managed by the signed-in Mac app.

The app installer enables the local MCP server. For a manual install, enable
it under **Settings → MCP Server**. Then start a new thread. The first time an
agent connects, Recall verifies the outermost signed host and shows a prompt
for that host. Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor have separate grants and separate
attribution; approving one never approves the others. Nothing is cached on disk.

No explicit login command and no browser step are needed. If the server does
not appear, run `codex mcp list` or `claude mcp list` to inspect the registered
name, or open Cursor's plugin details under **Customize**. Claude Code plugin servers are namespaced, so it normally appears as
`plugin:recall:recall`.

If the prompt does not appear, bring Recall to the front — the prompt waits
without stealing focus, and a connection that waits too long is refused with a
message telling the agent to open Recall. A denied or revoked grant is
remembered so a restarting agent cannot re-prompt in a loop; clear it with
**Allow again** under Settings → MCP Server → Local bridge access.

For missing tools, use the **doctor** skill in Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor.
It is passive by default and distinguishes host process evidence from the
current conversation's tool inventory. Codex and Cursor can share processes
across conversations, so a running bridge does not establish that this chat
has Recall available. Their journal hooks request a current-tool check and
report missing coverage without silently switching journal modes. Doctor's
optional `--probe` needs explicit user permission and tests a new connection,
not the conversation's existing connector. Neither a read tool nor a healthy
connection proves a work session is being recorded.

Each session names the transport it used in the host's MCP log
(`[recall] transport: local-socket` or `transport: oauth-http`) — the fastest
way to tell which path a connection took.

On the OAuth fallback path, plugins register useful client names: **Cursor**
for the Cursor plugin, **Codex** for
the Codex plugin, **Claude** for every surface using the shared Claude plugin,
and **Claude Desktop** for the standalone desktop extension. The names are
self-reported, advisory session labels rather than authenticated host
principals. Their credentials are cached separately, so each registration can be
revoked independently. Rows named **MCP CLI Proxy** came from older plugin
versions and cannot be assigned back to a host reliably; after the named
registrations work, revoke those legacy rows in Recall.

Do not keep the shared Claude plugin and the legacy standalone Recall desktop
extension installed together. They register two local MCP entries for the same
Recall app, which can duplicate tools and connection prompts. Keep the shared
plugin as the single Claude installation path described here.

That fallback reads the installed app's protected-resource metadata before
authorizing. Older Recall builds continue to request only `notes:read` and
`notes:write`; builds that advertise structured Project context also add
`journal:read`. An existing notes-only grant is replaced
through normal browser consent when those capabilities become available.
Native local-bridge sessions need no OAuth scopes. Recall's coordination
write tools (typed timeline entries, handoffs, directed asks, comment
replies, and session open/close) are gated on `journal:write`, which this
bridge still does not request — on the OAuth fallback the coordination
surface is read-only, while the native local bridge carries the full
policy-permitted catalog. Workspace Block/Read/Write
policy remains the independent data-access gate on both transports.

Older app builds without OAuth support can still use the shared bearer token —
see the legacy setup section in the
[plugin README](plugins/recall/README.md).

Start a new thread after installing and authorizing so the plugin tools are
loaded. The local bridge stores no client OAuth credential; Recall persists
only the user's host-specific approval state.

Write tools appear when at least one confirmed workspace is set to **Write**
in Recall's MCP Server settings. A workspace omitted from the policy remains
blocked.

The skills inspect the current MCP catalog before using newer note capabilities.
When available, they can read one named note's accepted activity and pair
canonical Markdown reads with opaque revision-checked content updates. Older
Recall builds keep the existing HTML/readback workflow; the skills never send
only half of the revision-safe field pair. Structured version 3 and version 4
project memory remain reader-only and exclusive, and never fall through to
these legacy named-note tools. Version 3 is repository-only. Version 4 remains
repository-first but can read one explicitly configured default Recall Project
only when the hook proves the session has no repository identity; it is never
an error fallback. Existing version 1/2 global users are not auto-migrated, so
their non-Git memory keeps working.

Version 5 is the structured writer. Plugin 0.28 offers it as an explicit
**Structured Project activity** setup choice only when the live Recall catalog
passes the complete schema gate and the user selects one exact write-ready
default Recall Project. Its sessions and human-scale checkpoints appear in
**Today -> Now activity**. Switching from a legacy v1/v2 config requires a
separate confirmation that global and filesystem-path routing will not carry
over; existing journal notes remain untouched archive.

A separate **version 6 session-recording pilot** adds deterministic edit-boundary
opening, explicit begin/status controls for reviews and shell work, same-connection
delivery, and visible pending state. It is off by default; its host profiles are
not automatically registered, and real host certification remains a release
gate. Stop is only a yield, and conversation segments survive steering,
compaction, reconnect, and resume. Existing modes are unchanged. See
[the pilot contract and verification gate](docs/deterministic-session-lifecycle.md)
before opting in.

The plugin supports multiple skills in its `skills/` directory. In addition to
the direct note workflow, the journal skill
(`$recall:recall-journal` in Codex,
`/recall:recall-journal` in Claude Code, and `/recall-journal` in Cursor)
configures a per-agent `recall-journal.json` in one of two complete modes: v7
Structured Project activity, with global and filesystem-path destinations that
each name a Recall Project (existing v5 and v6 configs stay readable), or a v2
legacy global/filesystem-path journal destination selecting a Recall workspace
and optional Recall Project. The hook reports when a saved config is older
than v7 or cannot be read as any version; the skill then offers a confirmed
upgrade or repair once per session through a bundled plan/apply helper, and
the hook itself never rewrites the file. Bundled session-start and
per-prompt hooks detect that valid opt-in config: the session event carries
the full journal context once, and each prompt a short reminder. They remind
the agent to search prior journal notes for
relevant context when a task relates to earlier work, and remind it to
journal meaningful work live in that write-ready workspace. In legacy mode,
each chat thread keeps exactly one journal note — a dateless topic-phrase title, a short
always-visible intro, and one collapsible toggle entry per checkpoint whose
summary line stays human-readable while agent detail and hidden bookkeeping
live inside the collapsed details — so an interrupted session leaves a
partial record instead of nothing, and a busy thread never scatters notes.
On days the thread wraps up meaningful work, the journal adds at most one
tiny ELI5 Today card linking to the thread's note (or none when day summaries
are disabled).
A config that still selects the retired legacy DailyNote summary target gets
a one-time prompt to switch to Today or none; the Recall server no longer
creates DailyNotes, so the journal never writes them.
Asking the agent to reconfigure the current filesystem
project updates only its destination in the same config, so sessions working
anywhere inside that project's folder — including Codex- or Claude-managed
linked worktrees stored elsewhere on disk — journal to the project's own
workspace and optional Recall Project instead of the global destination.

After installing or updating the plugin, start a new thread so its skills,
tools, and hook are loaded. Codex requires a one-time review and trust decision
for the plugin hook. The first explicit `$recall:recall-journal` invocation
checks the active Codex hook inventory and asks the user to open `/hooks` when
the Recall handler is new, modified, disabled, or missing. The skill never
changes or bypasses hook trust; Claude Code and Cursor skip this Codex-only
preflight. Cursor runs its native `sessionStart` hook and reads its
separate config under `~/.cursor`. The hook reads the per-agent
journal config, asks local Git for worktree metadata when available, and adds
agent context; the journal skill still validates the live workspace and
performs every note write through the Recall MCP server.
